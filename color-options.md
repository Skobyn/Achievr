Option 1: Trustworthy Blues with Warm Accents
Primary: Deep navy blue (#1E3A8A) - Conveys trust and security
Secondary: Teal (#0D9488) - Modern, financial growth
Background: Soft white/gray (#F8FAFC) - Clean, organized feel
Accents: Warm coral (#F97316) or amber (#F59E0B) - Family-friendly touch
Option 2: Growth-Focused Greens
Primary: Deep emerald (#047857) - Financial growth, prosperity
Secondary: Sky blue (#0EA5E9) - Trust, clarity
Background: Off-white (#F9FAFB) - Simple, clean
Accents: Soft purple (#9333EA) - Creativity, family joy
Option 3: Approachable Modern
Primary: Indigo (#4F46E5) - Professional but softer than navy
Secondary: Mint green (#10B981) - Fresh approach to finances
Background: Light neutral (#F3F4F6) - Clean interface
Accents: Soft rose (#FB7185) - Warmth, family connection
The most important considerations are:
Using calming, trustworthy colors for the main interface
Ensuring high contrast for financial numbers and data
Adding warm accents that make the experience feel less cold than traditional banking apps
Maintaining color accessibility standards (WCAG)
Would you like me to suggest specific changes to your current color theme based on one of these options?
