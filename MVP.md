Backend & Infrastructure
Database Setup:
You need a database to store user data, transactions, budgets, and financial records
PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or similar would work well
Database schemas for users, accounts, transactions, budgets, bills, goals
Authentication Service:
Your app has NextAuth integration, but you need to configure a proper authentication provider
Set up OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) or email/password authentication
API Connections:
Plaid API: You have Plaid components but need valid API keys and proper configuration
Set up Plaid development environment (plaid.com/developers)
Implement token exchange and data retrieval workflows
Core Functionality
Transaction Processing:
Backend logic to fetch, categorize, and store transactions from Plaid
Implement webhook handlers for real-time transaction updates
Budget Management:
Logic to create, track, and update budgets
Connect budget calculations to actual transaction data
Financial Reports:
Backend calculations for the charts and reports your frontend expects
Data aggregation services for the visualization components
Integration Tasks
Mobile-Web Sync:
API endpoints for the mobile app to connect to the web backend
Consistent data structures between platforms
Family Sharing:
User relationship models
Permission systems for shared financial data
Deployment
Backend Hosting:
Set up a server or serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions)
Configure environment variables
Database Hosting:
Provision a managed database service
Set up proper security configurations
Frontend Deployment:
Deploy NextJS app (Vercel, Netlify)
Set up proper environment variables and build processes
MVP Roadmap Priority
Set up database and user authentication
Implement Plaid integration for bank connectivity
Build core transaction import and categorization
Create basic reporting and dashboard functionality
Deploy minimum web application
Add budget tracking features
Add mobile sync capability
The most critical path to MVP involves setting up the database, authentication, and Plaid integration, as these form the foundation for all other features.
