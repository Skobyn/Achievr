# Active Context

## Current Focus
The primary focus is fixing authentication-related issues, particularly the redirect loops between the sign-in page and dashboard. The system currently has problems with authentication state persistence and proper page navigation after login.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented Firebase authentication integration, replacing Next-Auth
2. Added session persistence using both Firebase and localStorage
3. Implemented redirect loop prevention using sessionStorage flags
4. Enhanced sign-up and sign-in pages with better validation
5. Added auth protection to dashboard and other protected routes
6. Fixed various UI issues related to form submission states

## Active Issues
1. **Critical**: Infinite redirect loop between dashboard and sign-in pages
   - The dashboard redirects to sign-in when authentication state is not properly detected
   - Sign-in page redirects back to dashboard causing an infinite loop
   - Temporary solution using sessionStorage flags to break the loop

2. **High**: Authentication state persistence
   - Firebase auth state sometimes not persisting properly between page loads
   - Implemented localStorage backup to store authentication state
   - Need to ensure proper synchronization between Firebase and localStorage

3. **Medium**: Form validation and error handling
   - Improving user feedback for form validation errors
   - Ensuring consistent error handling for authentication failures

## Next Steps
1. Fix the redirect loop issue by:
   - Ensuring proper auth state detection in the dashboard
   - Implementing a more reliable redirect prevention mechanism
   - Adding better logging to identify the exact cause of the loop

2. Improve authentication robustness:
   - Ensure Firebase persistence is properly configured 
   - Implement a more reliable session management system
   - Add proper error handling for all authentication edge cases

3. Once authentication is stable:
   - Connect to Plaid API for bank account integration
   - Implement transaction fetching and categorization
   - Develop budget creation and management features

## Technical Decisions in Progress
1. Whether to use Firebase Firestore directly or create a backend API layer
2. How to structure data for family sharing capabilities
3. Approach for handling offline functionality
4. Best practices for securing financial data

## User Feedback
Initial users have reported:
1. Confusion about the sign-up process
2. Issues with staying logged in
3. Positive feedback on the dashboard UI
4. Requests for mobile app version
